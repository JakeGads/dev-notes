# IAM Section

Identity and Access Management

it is a global service

Root account is created by default, shouldn't be used or shared with any other context

- users are people in an org
- groups can be used to define user privilidges
    - a user can belong to zero, one or more groups
    - a group contains only users, not groups

## IAM: Permissions

Users and groups can be assigned a json document outling priveldges called policies

outlines what services each group is allowed to access, not everyone should be allowed to do everything

Least privilege principle, they don't get any more privildges than needed

## Practices

IAM dashboard allows you to create groups and handle permissions

You can also create a user

You will want a user that can admin instead of using just the root account for security purposes

Users can be set with passwords (custom or autogenerated) or through a factor key

Groups can be assigned, they are assigned policy's, cna be created or you can use amazons

users can have tags assigned to them ie, you can use email or match them to a department

you can email login instructions from there, or download a csv of things

### Login

you can alias accounts, which will give you a signin link that you can use

alias refers to the name of the IAM itself where as the account refers to individual accounts

## Policies (inhertance)

Groups can have policies and everyone in that group will be applied

single users can recive inline policies (individual)

teams will inherit the highest order, for instance if I am part of Dev and Ops and Ops can delete but Dev can't I will still be able to delete beuase of ops

### Structure

    - Principal: account/user/role to which this policy is applied to
    - Action: array of allowed policies
    - Resource: List of resources to which the actions applied to
