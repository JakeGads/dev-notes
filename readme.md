# JakeGads's Dev Notes

I take notes for work (see the `/work` dir) and for personal (`/non-work` dir)

check marks mean the that section is done at least for the time being

Work will keep it towards things I have to learn from my job this includes

- Sequelize ✅
- EJS ✅
- Express JS
- Mocha + chai


non-work is what I am learning for myself

- AWS Associate Dev Cert
